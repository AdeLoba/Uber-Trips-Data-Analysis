# Uber-Trips-Data-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover interesting patterns and insights about Uber rides. The dataset contains information about Uber trips taken over a period of time, including details like trip start/end times, locations, distances, purposes, and categories (business/personal).

## How Was This Analysis Done?
**1.**	**Data Preparation**:
•	Cleaned the data by filling in missing information
•	Converted dates/times to proper formats
•	Broke down dates into month, year, start time, and end time.
•	Figured out the "time of day" (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night) based on when the ride started.
•	Calculated trip durations
•	Converted distances from miles to kilometers

**2.	Data Exploration:**
•	Created visualizations to show trip patterns
•	Analyzed trip categories and purposes
•	Examined when trips occur throughout the day

**3.	Key Visualizations:**
•	Bar charts showing business vs personal trips
•	Graphs displaying popular trip times
•	Analysis of trip distances and durations

**4. Save the Results:** Exported the cleaned data to a new file for future use.

## Key Findings
**• Busiest Months:** December was the peak with 146 trips (holiday rush?), followed by August (133) and November (122). January had the fewest (61) –   maybe post-holiday blues?

**• Common Starting Points:** Most rides started in "Cary" (201 times), with "Unknown Location" (148) and "Morrisville" (85) close behind. It seems      like this person was based in North Carolina, USA.

**• Trip Purposes:** Business trips dominated! Popular reasons:
    • Meetings (lots for work).
    • Meals/Entertainment (grabbing food on the go).
    • Errands/Supplies (quick runs to stores).
    • A chart in the notebook shows Business purposes way outnumber Personal ones.

**• Distances and Times:** Trips ranged from short hops (like 1 km) to longer ones (up to 500 km+). Most happened in the Afternoon or Evening, with durations from a few minutes to over an hour.
